        While we have taken the necessary measures to make our vacation rental
        safe for incoming guests, you also have a role to play in ensuring
        the safety and security of your party. There are actions you can follow
        to keep the house secure during your stay.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any time guests leave the vacation rental, it is their responsibility
          to ensure all windows and doors are closed and locked to maintain
          security and prevent wind, rain and water damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have installed a security camera system around the house. They work
          on a private network and are there for your protect and security.
          Please do not touch them or the server.

        <li>
          We are not responsible for the loss of any personal belongings or
          valuables. In case you misplace something in the house, please let us
          know so we can look out for the item during the check out cleaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parents must not leave children unattended at any time. Any guest
          injuries sustained inside the house are not covered by our vacation
          rental insurance.
