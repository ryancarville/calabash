      <p>
        While we know our guests won’t intentionally break anything at our
        vacation rental, we understand accidents can happen sometimes. Here is
        what you need to know about accidental damages or breakages during your
        stay.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Always report any accidental damages or breakages in a timely manner,
          especially before check-out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do not move any furniture from one room to another without
          agreeing to it with us first.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please don’t take any bath towels with you to the beach. There are
          beach towels for that!
        </li>
        <li>
          n case any damage to the property or its appliances is not covered by
          our insurance, the guest will pay for the repair/replacement costs in
          full.
