      <h2>Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        Your rental comes with maid service. We want you to “lime” in a clean
        home and not have to spend your valuable time wiping down the bathrooms.
        Our team comes 3 times a week to preform the basic cleaning duties. We
        also try to have a conscious conservation approach to washing. Towels
        and sheet are changed every 2nd visit. Together we can make a
        difference. If you wish to have fresh towels/sheet sooner please let us
        know.
