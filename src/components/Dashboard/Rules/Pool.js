      <h2>Pool Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Our guest love the unique private pool one the property. Here are some
        simple rules regarding the pool. Should have any question regarding the
        pool/operation please contact us. We are here to help!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No running/pushing/diving. This is for your own safety. The pool is an
          oversized plunge pool with a depth of 4 feet.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          No glass around the pool. This is a big safety issue. We have supplied
          plastic glassware of all kinds to avoid this entirely. Should you
          break a glass/plate please notify us. We do inspect the pool after
          your departure and if we find any broken glass in/around the pool we
          will charge a pool cleaning fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          No food in the pool. There are plenty of areas around the
          pool/property to enjoy your food. Inside the pool shouldn’t be one of
          them. This is a health issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guests must shower before entering the pool to rinse off any sand or
          excess sunscreen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pool requires the pump to be used at least 5 hours daily to filter
          the water property. We have set this to happen automatically, but with
          its design means the water will flow over the edges. There is a on/off
          switch in the kitchen to manually turn the pump on/off after the 5
          hours have elapsed. Please enjoy this feature as much as you like, but
          if you are not using the pool, please turn it off.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Deck</h2>
      <p>
        Our terrance and deck areas are available for you to kick back and relax
        with your family or friends. To keep this space in the best condition
        for future visitors to our vacation rental, please follow the guidelines
        as listed below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        {" "}
        <li>
          Please do not hang wet bathing suits, towels or clothing off the
          balcony railings as it may damage the wood or worse your clothing will
          be blown into the neighbors property.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you plan to eat lunch or dinner outside on the deck, please do not
          use glasses and instead use the plastic cups provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of any bad weather (rain, storms etc.), please put seat
          cushions and pillows in the cushion box on the pool deck.
