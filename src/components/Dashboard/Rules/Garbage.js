      <h2>Garbage/Recycling/Compost</h2>
      <p>
        We like to do our bit for the environment and we ask that our guests do
        the same! There are clearly labeled containers for recycling, composite
        and regular trash can for non-recyclables.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Please dispose of garbage and recycling in the proper containers.
        </li>
        <li>Our cleaning team will empty all bins on their regular visits.</li>
        <li>
          Should you fill one of the bins between the cleaning teams visits,
          please dispose of it in the appropriate bin(s) located next to the
          driveway gate outside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do not flush any sanitary products down the toilet. We provide
          a bin for this in each bathroom.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any food waste should go into the organic recycling bin, take care to
          use the correct compostable bin liner when replacing.
        </li>
