        Welcome to Calabash Villa! We know there are many beautiful properties
        to choose from for your holiday and we are grateful you chose to spend
        it with us. We know you will fall in love with our home and can’t wait
        for you to experience all the island has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below you will find all the information you will need during your stay.
        We do ask you either read thru it or if you are short on time, just
        click HERE and listen to a 90 second audio track which details the more
        important information. This is a mandatory request as island life
        (particularly Bequia) has some lifestyle guidelines which will not only
        keep the property in its best condition, but also to safe guard you from
        any unwanted expenses or experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please treat our property with the same respect you would your own home.
        We have put a lot of time, energy and love into making this home to be
        enjoyed by all our guests.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you maintain a good level of cleanliness durning your stay. If
        this is your first introduction to island life then you will quickly
        find out there are a lot of little critters that thrive off your
        dirtiness. To avoid the unwanted house guests please clean up after
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case of accidental damage, please report it to us and we will decided
        if and how much the cost of repair will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you will have lots laughter and fun during your stay, but please
        be considerate to the neighbors and keep noise to a minimum during
        night hours (22:00 - 07:30)
      </p>
      <p>
        Please ensure you read the house rules before your stay. Should you have
        any questions or concerns please contact us to discuss.
