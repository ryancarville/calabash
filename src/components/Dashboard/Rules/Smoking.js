      <h2>Smoking</h2>
      <p>
        Our vacation rental is a smoke-free zone inside. This is important to us
        in order to keep our property in the best condition possible. Guests can
        only smoke in outdoor areas such as the terrace or decks as long as you
        respect the rules we have in place.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Smoking is not allowed anywhere inside the property.</li>
        <li>Guests can only smoke outdoors in the designated areas.</li>
        <li>
          Please do not throw cigarette butts onto the property lawn. You should
          instead dispose of them in the ashtray provided. Failure to do so will
          result in a deduction from the security deposit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discovering guests have been smoking inside the property will also
          result in loss of the security deposit.
