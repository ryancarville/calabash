      <h2>Garden</h2>
      <p>
        As you will see we have taken a lot of pride in our little 1/2 acre of
        paradise. It is there for you to enjoy! Feel free to pick the
        fruit/herbs from the trees/garden. We only ask you be respectful and
        don’t harm the garden in anyway. If you notice that there is some issue
        with the garden please let us know and we will address it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also is there anything better than tucking into a barbecue on a sunny
        afternoon? We don’t think so! We provide all the necessary equipment to
        cook up a storm, please just be sure to follow the instructions below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Please use the designated barbecue utensils and not the regular
          kitchen tongs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be sure to clean the barbecue after use, it’s much more difficult to
          clean the next day!
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a bag of coal in the outdoor garden shed under the pool deck.
          If you run out during your stay, it’s your responsibility to buy a
          refill.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please only use the barbecue until 10 pm to keep noise and smells to a
          minimum for our neighbors.
