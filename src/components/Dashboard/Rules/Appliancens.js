      <p>
        You’ll find all the electrical appliances you need for a comfortable
        stay at our home. Please use them responsibly and ask other members of
        your party to do the same. This means adhering to the few rules we
        outline below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The washing machine is off limits to guest. Should you require
          washing, please let our cleaning team know and they will do the
          washing for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please make sure you switch off lights, fans or any other small
          electrical appliances when you go out. The same applies to air-con’s –
          we’re an eco-friendly home!
        </li>
        <li>
          In the unlikely case of a power outage, please call us before touching
          the control panel.
        </li>

          No compensation will be given for any temporary outage of electricity,
          gas, water or internet service.
