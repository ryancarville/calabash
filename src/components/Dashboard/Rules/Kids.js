      <p>
        We try to keep the property as ‘child-friendly” as possible. That said,
        parents always have the final responsibility for their children’s safety
        at all times. If you find anything that is unsafe or requires revision
        please contact us and we will see what can be done (with the exception
        of the pool). Here are a few guideline to help keep the property
        kid-safe.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never leave children unsupervised on the property at any time.</li>
        <li>
          The garden is wild in some places and such has some very steep areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The property is suitable for supervised children of any age.
          Unsupervised children should not be allowed on the property.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are 100% responsible for your children at all times durning your
          stay. As well as any disturbances to the neighbors.
        </li>
