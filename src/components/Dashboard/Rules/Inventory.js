        <h3>Dish Soap</h3>
        <p>
          We have provided dish soap for you use. Should you run out during your
          stay, please replace with the same brand from Doris. It is
          eco-friendly and causes less harm to our water supply.

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the welcome basket, there maybe some food items in the
          pantry. You are more than welcome to use any of them. Please just
          check the expiry date before use.

        <h3>Incense Basins</h3>
        <p>
          The two concrete basins located on the upstairs terrace and downstairs
          patio are for burning incense only. We encourage you to do this as not
          only does it provide a lovely sent but helps keep misquotes away.
          Should you decide you would like to use them, speak with us upon check
          in and we will walk you thru the directions.

        <p>
          Feel free to become the next master chef while taking in the view, but
          use the tools with respect like Gorgon Ramsey would. The kitchen was
          designed to to ensure everything has a home. Please clean and return
          the items to their original storage place.
