      <p>
        Just like you neighborhood back at home, the houses surrounding the
        property have full time residents residing in them. Please be sure
        to respect the community and try to keep noise levels to a minimum,
        especially after dark. By respecting the people and property around,
        your vacation will be more enjoyable.

          We hope you will have lots laughter and fun during your stay, but
          please be considerate to the neighbors and keep noise to a minimum
          during night hours (22:00 - 07:30)
        </li>

          If any neighbor reports excessive noise or unruly behavior, we may
          have to evict you from our property and terminate the vacation rental.
          This could result in a loss of security deposit and rental amount.

          In case of a dispute or neighbor complaint, it is your duty to notify
          us as soon a possible.
