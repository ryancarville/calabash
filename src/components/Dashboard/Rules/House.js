        <p>
          You’re on a tropical island, barefoot is how its suppose to be! This
          helps keep the floors and furniture clean.

        <h2>Tap water is not safe to drink</h2>
        <p>
          The truth is the water is actually the freshest you can get being rain
          water, however, its that the tank may not have gotten fresh rain water
          for a while. So to be safe only drink from the kitchen sinks as they
          have filters or purchase bottled water from the local shops. It is
          safe to use the water for tooth brushing.

        <h2>Close and Lock Doors/Windows</h2>
        <p>
          Bequia is a safe island, but just like anywhere else in the word that
          doesn’t mean there aren’t incidents of bad behaviour. This is to
          protect your personal items as well as the items belonging to the
          property. You will also find personal safes in each room.

        <h2>Private Closest</h2>
        <p>
          If a door is locked, it’s private. Please do not attempt to open it.
          We are not fans of having placard posted around the home. Not only is
          this unnecessary as you are respectful guests, but also subtracts from
          the overall design of the property.

        <h2> Air Conditioning</h2>
        <p>
          We have installed personal a/c units in each bedroom for your comfort.
          You will discover that they are not needed much at all with the lovely
          breeze. But should you want to cool down please use it thoughtfully.
          Ensure all doors and windows are closed while in use.

        <h2>Electrical Breaker</h2>
        <p>
          The breaker is located in the storage/washroom off the kitchen. You
          should not need to access it durning your stay. However, should the
          need arise, please contact us and we will assist you.
