      <h3>A match made in paradise...with a little help from Tinder</h3>

      <p>
        Ryan's first introduction to the unheard of island of Bequia was via his
        uncle James Carville who built the first expat house in Friendship Bay
        in 1968. As a child he was fascinated by the tales of a palm lined 7
        mile piece of land in the farthest reaches of the Caribbean Sea. It was
        then that he decided one day, he would travel to this enchanted island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zeenath came upon the island after a exhausting search of a midway point
        between San Francisco and Zurich as a meeting point for her and her two
        best friends. The only criteria they had was to find an island which no
        known resorts. A true 'deserted' island. The second she discovered the
        name "Bequia" she was instantly drawn to it. They was some sort of magic
        in the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christmas 2013 Zeenath and Ryan both packed and set off one a trip that
        would change their lives forever. Zeenath first stayed at Casa Rosaline
        on Lower Bay. The only on beach property on the island. It was absolute
        paradise. More than she could have ever imagined. Ryan finally reached
        the home he had been imaging his entire life. It was almost like a
        dream. The house tucked away in the jungle towering above the sea. He
        could feel the stories coming to life around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        That Christmas was magical. New Years (or Old Years as it's called on
        island) was better than any either of them spent in New York City,
        London, San Francisco or Zurich. Every day that went by during that
        month long trip solidified their future individual returns. And believe
        it or not, durning that entire month on the 7 mile long island, their
        paths never crossed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the following 2 years both Zeenath and Ryan returned to the island
        at the exact same time and never met. They cultivated new friendships
        and even a romance here and there, but never did they even see the other
        on a beach. In a restaurant. Or around the harbor. If it was left to
        them, their paths may not ever cross.
      </p>

        The trip of 2014 fate would not leave their meeting up to chance any
        longer. Christmas and New Years came and went. It seemed like it was
        just another amazing trip to the island they both had become so fond of
        with people they had come to love. It was a lazy Tuesday when Ryan sat
        under a palm on Lower Bay which he sat under on most days (only 100
        meters from Zeenath) and decided to see if technology could help him
        meet any new islanders. He opened Tinder. Yes, Tinder. Ryan knew there
        wouldn't be the thousands of people in he radius like he was used to in
        New York, but he thought there had to be at least a few. In fact there
        was only one, Zeenath. He was imminently drawn to her eyes. They felt
        like he had seem them before, but he couldn't place where. Ryan swiped
        right. And it wasn't more than a day later when his phone buzzed. He had
        a new match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of all the beaches, in the entire world, they found each other on Lower
        Bay with a little help from technology. They couldn't believe the
        chances. It was a whirl wind romance. They finally met on January 3rd
        2015, and Ryan was flying back to New York on the 6th. Only 3 days. It
        felt cruel. They stayed in touch for the next few weeks and Ryan decided
        he had to she her again. So he planned a trip to Big Sur and invited
        Zeenath to join him. It was then they both knew they had found their
        life partner. Within 3 months Ryan traded in a New York life for a San
        Francisco one and their life together began.
      </p>
      <p>
        The years went by and life was better with each other in it. In 2017
        they married at The Old Fort in Mt Pleasant on Bequia. The wedding
        couldn't have been more perfect. Surrounded by family and friends from
        Bequia and the globe, it was a fairly tale.
      </p>

        Owning a home on the island was never a question given how integral the
        strip of land had become in their lives. They question was just when and
        where. After months of searching Zeenath came across a cute half
        finished property named Calabash. It required a lot of work, but had a
        view they had never seen before in all the year they had explored the
        island. It felt like they found their property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly enough they property was owned by a very close friend of theirs
        who wasn't even that interested in selling, but with after a few
        conversations they closed on the property in September 2018. In January
        of 2019 work began to create Calabash Villa as you see it today.
